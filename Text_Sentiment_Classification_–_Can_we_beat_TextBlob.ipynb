        "\n",
        "## **Introduction**\n",
        "The popular Python library TextBlob provides a tool for sentiment analysis of texts. Texts are labeled on a scale from very negative (–1) to very positive (1).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, I will try to create a sentiment analyzer that can beat TextBlob in accuracy, as measured on two separate datasets.\n",
        "## **Data**\n",
        "I will be working with two datasets\n",
        "### **Dataset 1**\n",
        "[Sentiment Labelled Sentences](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/331/sentiment+labelled+sentences) from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) consists of a total of 3,000 reviews from Amazon, IMDB, and Yelp, which have been manually selected for being clearly positive or clearly negative; no neutral reviews are included. The dataset is perfectly balanced: there are 1,000 reviews from each of the three sources, and out of those, half are negative and half are positive. The columns are:\n",
        "* **source:** amazon, imdb, or yelp; string\n",
        "* **text:** the review text; string\n",
        "* **label:** 0 (negative sentiment) or 1 (positive sentiment); string (which I will convert to int)\n",
        "\n",
        "As a curated dataset without missing values, this dataset can be used without any cleaning whatsoever, but I will check whether I get better results by applying standard text-cleaning procedures, such as removing non-alpha characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "I will call this dataset **mixed_reviews** (meaning it mixes reviews from three sources).\n",
        "### **Dataset 2**\n",
        "**Clothing, Shoes, and Jewelry** is a dataset available from the GitHub repository [Amazon Reviews’23](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/). It contains some 278k amazon reviews pertaining to clothing, shoes, or jewelry items. This dataset has not been labeled for sentiment, but it contains the customer’s star rating, from 1 to 5, which can be used as an approximation for sentiment. There are nine columns, but I will only use these two:\n",
        "* **reviewText:** the text of the review: string\n",
        "* **overall:** the star-rating, 1 - 5; string (which I will convert to int)\n",
        "\n",
        "I will call this dataset **amazon**.\n",
        "\n",
        "I will split the labeled **mixed_reviews** dataset into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%), and train three types of machine-learning models on the training set.\n",
        "## **Models**\n",
        "### [LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)\n",
        "\n",
        "LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to process sequential data and capture long-term dependencies. Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTMs use memory cells and gates to retain relevant information over longer sequences. This makes them well-suited for sentiment analysis, where the sentiment of a sentence might depend on words appearing earlier in the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "I will try a few different architectures, with either one or two regular LSTM layers, or a single bidirectional layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "### [CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)\n",
        "While CNNs are commonly associated with image processing, [they can also be used for text classification](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/text-classification-using-cnn/) by treating text as a one-dimensional sequence. In text classification, CNN uses convolutional layers to extract n-gram features (i.e., phrases of length n tokens) from the text and identify these n-grams as positive or negative. CNNs are good at detecting local patterns, which is valuable for sentiment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "I will explore a single architecture with one convolutional 1D layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "### [DistilBERT (Distilled Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/distilbert)\n",
        "\n",
        "DistilBERT is a smaller, faster (“distilled”) version of the pre-trained BERT model, which uses a transformer architecture to capture contextual relationships between words. Unlike traditional machine-learning models, transformers process entire sequences simultaneously, allowing them to understand how words influence each other. DistilBERT is pre-trained on a large corpus, giving it an understanding of language structure and semantics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Embeddings**\n",
        "### [GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/distilbert)\n",
        "GloVe embeddings are pre-trained word vectors that represent words as dense vectors in a continuous vector space. These vectors are trained on large text corpora, from which they learn the semantic relationships between words. As an example, in the GloVe embedding space, synonyms will have vectors close to each other, and the vector for “king” minus “man” plus “woman” is close to the vector for “queen.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The DistilBERT model already has an understanding of semantics, since it is pre-trained on a large text corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "The LSTM and CNN models don’t in themselves have any such semantic understanding, but by using GloVe embeddings with these models, we give them a semantic understanding, similar to what the DistilBERT model has inherently.\n",
        "## **Evaluation**\n",
        "After training my three models on the training set from the Mixed Reviews dataset, I will test their and TextBlob’s accuracy on:\n",
        "* The test set from the Mixed Reviews set.\n",
        "* A random selection of reviews from the Amazon Reviews set, where I will consider 1- and 2-star reviews as being negative, and 4- and 5-star reviews as being positive. I will exclude 3-star reviews, as their sentiment presumably is neutral (or an even mix of positive and negative).\n"

        "While the LSTM, CNN, and DistilBERT models are unlikely to output predictions of exactly 0.5 (i.e. right on the decision border between positive and negative), TextBlob quite often gives a sentiment score of 0. On the TextBlob range from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive), 0 means neuteral, and is what we will use as the decision boundary. Since I handle this as a binary classification task, I will have to filter out those reviews where the predicion is neither positive nor negative.\n",

        "\n",
        "We'll see below that the accuracy on the hold-out test set for the last (and best) model I ran is almost 93%. Furthermore, the confusion matrix shows a reasonable balance between false positives (17 texts) and false negatives (26 texts)."

        "So does that mean that I can now launch my DistilBERT-based text-sentiment analysis tool and put TextBlob out of business?\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, not quite. It must be admitted that TextBlob is a ready-made tool that can be applied to any text set. My DistilBERT model, on the other hand, had the benefit of being evaluated on reviews very similar to those that it was trained on; it was tested on unseen data, as is appropriate, but unseen data of the same kind it had learned from. If we took the DistilBERT model that was trained on this dataset and tested it on some ofther kind of texts, such as tweets or newspaper articles, it's likely that it would do much worse, since sentiments in those texts might be expressed somewhat differently than in the customer reviews that our model was trained on. For TextBlob, on the other hand, there is no reason to think that it would necessarily perform worse on any other data than it did on these reviews. So TextBlob remains safe from my challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "What can be said though, is that if you want to perform sentiment analysis on a set of some specific kind of texts and have access to (or have the resources to generate) a large enough number of labeled samples, then it's quite possible that you can build a machine-learing model that will outperform TextBlob on that particular kind of texts. After all, the 15.6 point margin by which I beat TextBlob is pretty resounding.\n",

        "## **Ideas for future work**\n",
        "As suggested above, it would be interesting to test a DistilBERT model trained on one particular kind of texts, e.g. the reviews I used, and then test it on texts of another kind, to see how much the performance would suffer.\n",
        "\n",
        "It would also be interesting to conduct a more thorough search of the architecture and hyper-parameter space for the LSTM and CNN models, to see if their performance could be brought closer to that of the DistilBERT model. Those models have the advantage over DistilBERT that they are much faster to train.\n",
